    <p>Cats are wonderful creatures. They are the only animal known to have self-domesticated, have lived among us for thousands of years, and were once worshiped as gods.</p>

    <p>Cats have very distinct personalities; one cat's behaviour and likes or dislikes may be polar opposite of another.</p>
